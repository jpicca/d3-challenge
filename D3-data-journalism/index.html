          <h2>Correlations Demographics and Health Trends</h2>
          <p>It's fairly evident that states with lower median incomes tend to see higher proportions of obese residents. 
            One potential cause is that the lower nutritional value of cheaper foods could lead to higher occurrences of
            obesity among a population. Additionally, reduced access to healthcare and fitness programs likely promotes
            higher rates of obesity.</p>

          <p>Another interesting trend in our data is the correlation between the smoking rate and median income / % in
            poverty. In states with lower incomes and higher poverty rates, smoking prevalence appears to be higher. One 
            possible influence again related to healthcare / wellness access. With reduced income, addictions such as
            smoking may be tougher to overcome.
          </p>

          <p>Regarding median age, younger states appear to have a greater percentage of individuals without healthcare.
            This could be an artifact of younger individuals generally being less incentivized to purchase healthcare, due
            to their lower personal wealth and better background health (versus older individuals).
